Here is where all of the base files of the places we create will go.
As of now the layout of the file will be as follows and will be edited later
by adding more attributes to the back of the list:

Place files: (placename.txt)
	name -> string of a name
	description -> string of the description. NO NEWLINES
	connectionnames -> list of connections seperated by commas.
			   if there is just one connection still put a
			   comma after it.
		example: placeone,placetwo,place3 | NO SPACES OR BRACKETS
	leave a blankline at the end of every place file for following clean
	standards of pep8

There will be no need for the blank user file since we can specify the starting
attributes on the person object creation.
